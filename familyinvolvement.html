     <h3> Volunteer Hours</h3>

    <div>The Enrollment and Tuition Agreement at Berkwood Hedge includes a  commitment from each family to contribute 40 hours of work to the school  per year.&nbsp; Single parents/guardians are asked to contribute 20 hours  per year. This commitment not only helps keep tuition more affordable  but also involves parents/guardians in the life of the school as  volunteers in the classroom, on field trips, on the grounds, in the  office, at events, and with fundraising projects.&nbsp; Ten of the 40 hours  (or five of the 20 hours), must be devoted to school-wide development  activities.</div><br /><div>Formerly, we called these "Fundraising Hours" but have renamed them  "Development Hours" to encompass more than fundraising activities,  including activities related to alumni, friends and family, and  community relations.</div><hr />
